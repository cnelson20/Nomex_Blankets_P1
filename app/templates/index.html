        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <p>
          Checkers is played by two players, on opposite sides of an 8x8 checkered
          gameboard. Only the dark squares of the checkered board are used. One player has the dark pieces; the other has the light
          pieces. Players alternate turns moving their own pieces. A move consists 
          of moving a piece diagonally to an adjacent unoccupied square. 
          If the adjacent square contains an opponent's
          piece, and the square immediately beyond it is vacant, the piece may
          be captured (and removed from the game) by jumping over it into the vacant square.
          A piece may move only diagonally into an unoccupied square. Only one piece may be captured
          with a single jump, but multiple jumps are allowed in a single turn. When presented, capturing is
          mandatory in most official rules and where the player does not capture
          the opposing player can remove the opponent piece as penalty and where
          there are two or more such positions the player forfeits that/those he
          cannot move. Although some rule variations make capturing optional. For our variation, capturing is optional,
          but if you capture once and can jump again you must jump again.  If a player
          loses all their pieces or is unable to move a piece because they are blocked they lose.
